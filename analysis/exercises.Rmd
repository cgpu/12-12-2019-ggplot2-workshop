# Introduction

## Description

Below is a list of tasks that were developed in different groups for ggplot workshops on December 12, 2019. https://www.facebook.com/events/2336582616605870/


## Task difficulty


Task difficulties are described by stars (`*`) next to their titles and they correspond to the estimated times that a novice participant should devote to them, where:
<br />
* - for 10 min<br />
**  - for 20 min<br />
*** - more than 30 min<br />

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


#loading relevant data etc.

```
<br /> <br /> 

# Exercises

##  A scatter plot of the dependence of coefficients with highlighted countries *



The purpose of the following task is to test your skills in using the `geom_point ()` function with various values marked on the `x` and `y` axes. In addition, (figure out how to) select the countries with the highest and lowest birth rates in the world.

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("SmarterPoland")
library(ggplot2)
library(SmarterPoland)

```
<br /> <br /> 

## Density of death rates on different continents **



The task is to prepare a density comparison of the death rate on continents using 5 figures displayed on different panels. Note the different graph colors, dotted lines and signatures.

<br /> <br /> 

## Populations *



The task should visualize the distribution of population among countries on different continents, both using a box and a scatter plot. Note the measure used in the `y` scale display.

<br /> <br /> 

## Complex column chart **



This visualisation will be generated for the `iris` data set and its purpose is to present different average values for individual species.

</center>

<br /> <br /> 

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
iris2 <- melt(iris, id.vars="Species")

```

## Movie ratings * 



The goal is to present the number of films in various evaluation ranges from the IMDB website.
(The size of the compartments is free, you don't have to specify it to solve the task).
The task requires the use of only basic functions and ggplot2 geometry

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

movies <- read.csv("data/movie_metadata.csv")


```
<br /> <br /> 

## Movie budgets *



Visualisation of the trend line of budgets in films over the years <br />
a) all IMDb films <br />
b) TOP 500 IMDb films, is everything OK with this visualisation?<br />

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

movies <- read.csv("data/movie_metadata.csv")

movies500 <- arrange(movies, desc(num_voted_users))
movies500 <- head(movies, 500)



```
<br /> <br /> 

## Actors **



The goal in this task is to reproduce the graph below with as many details as possible.
To facilitate the task, two functions have been given, the use of which is practically necessary.

</center>

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

movies <- read.csv("data/movie_metadata.csv")

movies_actors <- movies%>%
  group_by(aktor=actor_1_name)%>%
  summarise(ilosc=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(ilosc))%>%
  head(6)

head(movies_actors)

# 2 new things you will need to use
? geom_col
? coord_flip
```
<br /> <br /> 

## Are the movies getting worse? ***


The goal of the task is to accurately reproduce the graph from the photo below

<center>
![](assets/exercises/g3_styl_1.png)
</center>

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


movies <- read.csv("data/movie_metadata.csv")

movies_year <- movies%>%
  group_by(title_year)%>%
  summarise(score=mean(imdb_score))



```
